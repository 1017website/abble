            <p>
                We offer career tracks into high-billing desks or broader management (depending on your aspirations), underpinned by
                market-leading compensation and a commitment to learning and development. There are also opportunities to move
                internationally within the global Pure network- think New York, Hong Kong, and Europe.
                We offer on-the-job training within a supportive, collaborative environment where our team genuinely enjoy what they do.
                <br>
                Our Employee Engagement Survey proved this by revealing 100% of our staff would recommend Pure as a place to work. We
                care about your wellbeing and offer dedicated wellness resources including a wellness week, stress management and
                nutritional advice.
                <br>
                We're on a mission to surpass what is expected of recruitment and search firms; going beyond the 'transaction' to deliver a
                higher quality of service and smarter solutions. Our business values, Passion, Clarity, Know-How, and Commitment are
                making this happen.
